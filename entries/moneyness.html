This was kind of a funny thing I did from a dollar bill. I pleated the paper on the two sides of the face until i coaxed out the flaps to make arms and legs.

I guess I’ll try to say something about folding with non-square pieces of paper. I had always been on the side of the purists. I followed the belief that it was more “elegant” to fold using a square. Paper folding was about using creases to create structures, not cutting the paper into a specific shape to make those structures. So an uncut square was supposedly a flawless, spiritually symmetrical shape.

But the more I got into it, the more I began to feel that the reason we fold using a square is not because there’s some sort of sacred perfection to it. It’s rather the balance of symmetry and asymmetry that makes a square good to fold. That’s the feeling I get when I’m folding. I guess it has to do with how the edges of the square terminate the paper. If we were really trying to chase elegance, we might fold with an infinite plane of paper. But we have to make do in reality by cutting it off somewhere.

A circle would be a more “perfect” shape than a square. But it really doesn’t lend itself to folding very well. It’s too symmetrical. A square is more practical. The shape of the square kind of suggests folding patterns to you. A square has those 4 corner sticking out. To me a lot classical origami is about using creases to form sticking-out-ey bits of paper, called flaps. And because the corners of the square are already kind of sticking out-ish, they can readily be folded into flaps. I think this is neat. Since it’s more efficient to use corners than the edge of the paper to create flaps, the corners are useful.

But I’m also thinking about the idea of the “impurity” of cutting the paper. Really, just by using a square sheet of paper you are using cuts in the creating structure of your origami model. The paper was either produced as a square, or cut into the shape of a square. Any folding you do really just tries to hide or accentuate that shape of the paper. The corners of the square are important landmarks for folding, but they’re only like that because they were cut that way.

I’m not sure what I’m trying to say here. If I fold with squares because they are not perfect, then why not other shapes? It feels like a fresh game to work with the proportions of nonsquares, think of how to fit a folding pattern to the shape of the paper. But I guess as long as the post-it company keeps mass producing square sheets of paper, I’m still happy to carry on the tradition of square-sheet origami.
