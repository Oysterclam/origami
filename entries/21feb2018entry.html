  Inspired by a funny looking avocet I saw while biking through the baylands. Unfortunately I did not have paper thin enough to really capture the skinniness of the bird, but I think this is a nice sketch nonetheless.

  It's based on a nice crease pattern of 15 degree folds which fit together quite satisfactorily. Unfortunately I can't share it with you because I forgot how it went. I think the legs take up a little less than half of the paper.

  To me it's important to keep in mind the kind of the paper you are using. 
  I feel it's easy to get caught up in complexity. I think it's harder to feel and understand the paper, to know how many layers you can put in your design without ruining it, to see how you can use the paper as more than simply a medium for the creases to reside in.
