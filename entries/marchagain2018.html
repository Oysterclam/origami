  I learned a lot trying to figure out how to fold a model like this.

<p>
Probably not the prettiest thing I ever folded but I really enjoyed the design and the process that I used. Before learning any of the ideas behind tree theory and that stuff my stuff used to be really disproportionate and inefficient. I think I’ll put a picture of my old folds if I can find it. I basically used one corner to make out a couple points to form the guy on a saddle, and fiddled to build the rest of the form around the finished rider. There are a bunch of wasted layers and flaps that I didn’t know how to deal with at the time. It looks really immature. 
  </p>
  <p>
The new one still has the same spirit of design, I made enough points for a person at one corner and then fiddled with the rest to get more legs. But it was organized and efficient. I folded while keeping in mind how the folding structures naturally interacted with each other, instead of trying to force things together like I used to. It’s kind of easier when basing everything on 22.5 degree angles to make everything fit together by itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ll figure out the crease pattern later. I think there’s some interesting stuff that I did because I did some weird layering things. I guess there was kind of a shortcut or something I did to make more paper available than with normal circle packing kind of design. I think I may have just messing up though. I’ll look closer
